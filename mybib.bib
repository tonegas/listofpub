abstract = {Driving requires the ability to handle unpredictable situations. Since it is not always possible to predict an impending danger, a good driver should preventively assess whether a situation has risks and adopt a safe behavior. Considering, in particular, the possibility of a pedestrian suddenly crossing the road, a prudent driver should limit the traveling speed. We present a work exploiting reinforcement learning to learn a function that specifies the safe speed limit for a given artificial driver agent. The safe speed function acts as a behavioral directive for the agent, thus extending its cognitive abilities. We consider scenarios where the vehicle interacts with a distracted pedestrian that might cross the road in hard-to-predict ways and propose a neural network mapping the pedestrian's context onto the appropriate traveling speed so that the autonomous vehicle can successfully perform emergency braking maneuvers. We discuss the advantages of developing a specialized neural network extension on top of an already functioning autonomous driving system, removing the burden of learning to drive from scratch while focusing on learning safe behavior at a high-level. We demonstrate how the safe speed function can be learned in simulation and then transferred into a real vehicle. We include a statistical analysis of the network's improvements compared to the original autonomous driving system. The code implementing the presented network is available at https://github.com/tonegas/safe-speed-neural-network with MIT license and at https://zenodo.org/communities/dreams4cars.},

The resulting Agent, developed in an EU H2020 Research and Innovation Action, is used to concretely demonstrate the emergence of adaptive behaviour with a significant level of autonomy. Guidelines to adapt the same principled organization of the sensorimotor system to other agents for driving are also obtained.

abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to learning predictive motor control via ‘‘mental simulations''. The method, inspired by learning via mental imagery in natural Cognition, develops in two phases: first, the learning of predictive models based on data recorded in the interaction with the environment; then, at a deferred time, the synthesis of inverse models via offline episodic simulations. Parallelism with human-engineered control-theoretic workflow (mathematical modeling the direct dynamics followed by optimal control inversion) is established. Compared to the latter human-directed synthesis, the mental simulation approach increases autonomy: a robotic agent can learn predictive models and synthesize inverse ones with a large degree of independence. Human modeling is still needed but limited to providing efficient templates for the forward and inverse neural networks and a few other directives. One could consider these templates as the efficient brain network typologies that evolution produced to permit live beings quickly and efficiently learning. The structure of the neural networks —both forward and inverse ones— is made of interpretable ‘‘local models'', which follows the cerebellar organization (and are also similar to local model approaches known in the literature). We demonstrate the learning of a first-round model (contrasted to Model Predictive Control) for lateral vehicle dynamics. Then, we demonstrate a second learning iteration, where the forward/inverse neural models are significantly improved.},

Such a model makes it possible to predict the system response in operational conditions, and thus it is employed to design and evaluate a DEG-based WEC that features an effective dynamic response. The model is validated through the design and test of a small-scale prototype, whose dynamics is tuned with waves at tank-scale using a set of scaling rules for the DEG dimensions introduced here in order to comply with Froude similarity laws.

Two classes of tests are described: dry-run laboratory tests on DEG samples, and wave tank tests on scaled Oscillating Water Column (OWC) prototypes housing functional DEG PTO.

Specifically, a desktop haptic device is employed to induce a programmable hand-tremor, that is typically observed in people affected by some kind of neurological diseases, on healthy subjects (i.e., the designers). The developed tool is based on a wrist-attached haptic interface with a workspace that is comparable to that of the arm of the user. Such device is able to exert controlled forces on the user's wrist and induces a hand-tremor whose frequency and amplitude are correlated with those measured on impaired people. The control of the device is based on a custom trajectory-tracking algorithm that takes as input tremor signals that are acquired on patients using an optical motion tracking system.

In this paper, we present a concept of near/off-shore Oscillating Water Column (OWC) Wave Energy Converter (WEC) that is equipped with a Power Take Off (PTO) unit based on Dielectric Elastomer Generators (DEGs). DEGs are soft/deformable generators with variable capacitance able to directly convert the mechanical energy that is employed for their deformation into electrostatic energy. The proposed WEC is based on an existing tubular collector chamber of an OWC system designed by the company Sendekia, that is combined with an Inflatable Circular Diaphragm (ICD) DEG. This simplified design presents a very reduced number of moving parts showing potentially high efficiency, reliability and noise-free operation. A multi-physics dynamic model of the system is built using time domain linear hydrodynamics coupled with an analytical non-linear electro-hyperelastic model for the DEG-based PTO. The power matrix of the system is calculated for both regular and irregular waves. Some design issues are introduced showing that the electro-elastic response of the DEG provides the system with an additional stiffness that adds up to the hydrostatic stiffness and affects the resonance of the WEC. As a consequence, the geometric shape/dimensions of the OWC chamber and the layout of the DEG diaphragm should be chosen using an integrated procedure aimed at tuning the overall response of the WEC to the spectra a reference wave climate.},

To achieve this goal, two different Power-Take-Off (PTO) systems for Oscillating Water Column (OWC) devices are compared from a techno-economic perspective. In this context, the shoreline OWC plant deployed on the Pico Island in the archipelago of Azores (Portugal) is considered as the reference scenario for this study. First, the numerical assessment of the Pico Plant fitted with a conventional Wells air turbine is performed, and secondly, the same assessment is carried out after replacing the air turbine with an Inflatable Circular Diaphragm (ICD) DEG. A tailored Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) assessment, which relies mostly on the device power matrix and a cost database, gives an estimate of the economic value of the two OWC configurations. The paper not only reports the key results from the dynamic simulations such as the power matrices but also documents the path towards the calculation of the economic performance of the two systems. Given the uncertainty of some key input parameters and the significant difference in Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) between the two PTOs (Wells turbine and ICD-DEG), a sensitivity analysis is performed to set some target values that DEG should achieve to compete with traditional air turbines.},

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} 2015 by ASME. Dielectric elastomers (DE) are incompressible rubberlike solids whose electrical and structural responses are highly nonlinear and strongly coupled. Thanks to their coupled electromechanical response, intrinsic lightness, easy manufacturability, and low-cost, DEs are perfectly suited for the development of novel solid-state polymeric energy conversion units with capacitive nature and high-voltage operation, which are more resilient, lightweight, integrated, economic, and disposable than traditional generators based on conventional electromagnetic technology. Inflated circular diaphragm dielectric elastomer generators (ICD-DEG) are a special embodiment of polymeric transducer that can be used to convert pneumatic energy into usable electricity. Potential application of ICD-DEG is as power take-off system for wave energy converters (WEC) based on the oscillating water column (OWC) principle. This paper presents a reduced, yet accurate, dynamic model for ICD-DEG that features one kinematic degree of freedom and which accounts for DE visco-elasticity. The model is computationally simple and can be easily integrated into existing wave-to-wire models of OWCs to be used for fast analysis and real-time applications. For demonstration purposes, integration of the considered ICD-DEG model with a lumped-parameter hydrodynamic model of a realistic OWC is also presented along with a simulation case study.},
